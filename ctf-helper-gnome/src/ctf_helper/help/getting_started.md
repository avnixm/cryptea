# Welcome to GNOME CTF Helper

This handbook ships with the application so you can stay productive while offline.

## Workflow overview

1. **Create a challenge** using the “+” button and record the high level details.
2. **Capture notes** in Markdown and use the live preview to keep write-ups tidy.
3. **Leverage offline tools** such as the hash digester, classic cipher helpers, and file inspector.
4. **Export** a `.ctfpack` archive to back up your workspace or move it to another machine.

## Offline best practices

- Keep reference material in the bundled help topics — no browser required.
- When you need to reference an external URL, copy it from the offline link dialog and review it later from a networked host.
- Use the snapshots folder for incremental backups of your notes during long investigations.
