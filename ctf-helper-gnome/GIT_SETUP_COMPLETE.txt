WHAT TO COMMIT NOW:
================================================================================

To commit all your changes (renamed to Cryptea, cleanup, etc):

1. Stage all changes:
   cd /home/avnixm/Documents/cryptea/ctf-helper-gnome
   git add -A

2. Commit with descriptive message:
   git commit -m "Major refactor: Rename to Cryptea and cleanup project

   - Renamed project from CTF Helper to Cryptea
   - Updated all branding (app name, icons, desktop file)
   - Removed network availability alert
   - Comprehensive README.md (749 lines)
   - Removed 18+ temporary documentation files
   - Added comprehensive .gitignore
   - Excluded tests/ and build artifacts from version control
   - Command: cryptea (was ctf-helper)
   - App ID: org.example.Cryptea"

3. Push to remote (if configured):
   git push origin main

VERIFICATION:
================================================================================

After committing, verify what's tracked vs ignored:

# See what's tracked
git ls-files | head -20

# Verify tests are ignored
git check-ignore tests/

# Check for any untracked files you might want to add
git status --short

YOUR PROJECT IS NOW:
================================================================================
‚úÖ Clean repository structure
‚úÖ Tests excluded from commits (but kept locally)
‚úÖ Build artifacts ignored
‚úÖ No IDE files in repo
‚úÖ Professional .gitignore
‚úÖ Ready to push to GitHub/GitLab

REMINDER:
================================================================================
The tests/ folder still exists on your local disk - it's just not tracked
by git anymore. You can still run tests locally with:

   pytest tests/

But they won't be committed or pushed to your remote repository.
